stm32flash
==========

Fork of https://sourceforge.net/p/stm32flash/code/ci/master/tree/

* minor enhancement to upstream code ...
* to add support for opening /dev/pts/N tty device special file ...
* connected to a "Blue Pill" STM32F103 USB device ...
* running [buck50](https://github.com/thanks4opensource/buck50) firmware ...
* whose [papoon_usb](https://github.com/thanks4opensource/papoon_usb) USB CDC-ACM library does not support changing baud rate, parity, bit size, stop bits, etc. ...
* via USB setup packets ...
* sent from a *NIX host via `tcsetattr()` library calls ...
* thus causing `stm32flash` to error exit when `tcsetattr()` and/or `tcgetattr()` fail.

Fork adds a new `-N` commandline option to bypass `tcsetattr()`/`tcgetattr()` in `serial_posix.c:serial_setup()`.

Baud rate, etc. is instead set using [buck50.py](https://github.com/thanks4opensource/buck50/blob/master/build/buck50.py) user interface before invoking `stm32flash`.
